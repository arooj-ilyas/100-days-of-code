# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Computational Thinking and Pair Programming

**Thoughts:** Worked on a CSS Diner task to play with the idea of Pair Programming and understand how selectors and attritubes work. I feel like I am slowly getting better at it and understanding how CSS works. I have never come across pair programming before and CSS is still very new for me, but I managed to recall some of what I had learnt in the introduction session with School of Code last week and applied it to the task.

### Day 2: September 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Git Rhythm

**Thoughts**: I understood the functionality of GitHub better than I did before and became familiar with the idea of using git functions such as init, add, commit, status, log. I did struggle with using the git clone, push and pull but I think with practice I will get better at it. I feel quite good about using IDE's like VS Code and have managed to correctly set up bash on my mac.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
