**Today's Progress**: Computational Thinking and Pair Programming

**Thoughts:** Worked on a CSS Diner task to play with the idea of Pair Programming and understand how selectors and attritubes work. I feel like I am slowly getting better at it and understanding how CSS works. I have never come across pair programming before and CSS is still very new for me, but I managed to recall some of what I had learnt in the introduction session with School of Code last week and applied it to the task.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
