# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Computational Thinking and Pair Programming

**Thoughts:** Worked on a CSS Diner task to play with the idea of Pair Programming and understand how selectors and attritubes work. I feel like I am slowly getting better at it and understanding how CSS works. I have never come across pair programming before and CSS is still very new for me, but I managed to recall some of what I had learnt in the introduction session with School of Code last week and applied it to the task.

### Day 2: September 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Git Rhythm

**Thoughts**: I understood the functionality of GitHub better than I did before and became familiar with the idea of using git functions such as init, add, commit, status, log. I did struggle with using the git clone, push and pull but I think with practice I will get better at it. I feel quite good about using IDE's like VS Code and have managed to correctly set up bash on my mac.

### Day 3: September 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to JavaScript

**Thoughts** Today I finally became much more familiar and used to the idea of Git Pull --> Git Add --> Git Commit --> Git Push. I was introduced to the basics of JavaScript, how it was formed and the 5 pillars of programming in JS. Worked in Pair Programming to link HTML and JS files in VS Code, then went on to complete workshops tackling creating variables, if and else-if loops. Found this quite hard and took quite a while to get my head around, definitely need further practice here.

**Code Snippet:**
let userPassword=prompt("please enter password"); 

if (userPassword === "myPassword1!") {
    console.log (userPassword);
    alert("I'm secretly an alien");
}

else if (userPassword !== "myPassword1!") {
    alert("WRONG! Try again");
    count = count + 1; 
 }
